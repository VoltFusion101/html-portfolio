<h2 class="note" value="2">Hello there! Here is Nia.</h2>
<p class="note">
    Motivated and adaptable individual with a background in management and basic accounting. <br/>
    Currently expanding expertise in programming, editing and design,<br/>
    with a passion for continuous learning and skill development.<br/>
    I have a keen eye for beauty and love editing to enhance visuals.<br/>
    I enjoy seeing and working with art and nature.<br/>
    While I can't draw, I prefer to work with computers to create something beautiful through digital tools and design.<br/>
    I love chocolate—but not when it’s too sweet—and I can’t stand hot weather!
