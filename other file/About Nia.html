<h2>Hello! Here is Nia.</h2>
I'm currently learning programming,<br/>
but my main passion are management and design.<br/>
I have a keen eye for beauty and love editing to enhance visuals.<br/>
While I can’t draw, I enjoy seeing and working with art and nature.<br/>
I love chocolate—but not when it’s too sweet—and I can’t stand hot weather!
