<h2>Hello there! Here is Nia.</h2>
Motivated and adaptable individual with a background<br/> in management and basic accounting.<br/>
Currently expanding expertise in programming, editing and design,<br/>with a passion for continuous learning and skill development.<br/>
I have a keen eye for beauty and love editing to enhance visuals.<br/>
While I can’t draw, I enjoy seeing and working with art and nature.<br/>
I love chocolate—but not when it’s too sweet—and I can’t stand hot weather!
